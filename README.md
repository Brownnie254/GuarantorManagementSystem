# GuarantorManagementSystem
## Project Description

The Guarantor Management System is a platform designed to ease the process of getting a guarantor and requesting a guarantor for banks, SACCOs, and other loan-issuing organizations. The system streamlines operations and improves the overall user experience for loan applicants, guarantors, and financial institutions.

- **Loan Applicant Portal**: Allows applicants to request a loan and seek guarantors.
- **Guarantor Portal**: Enables guarantors to respond to requests and manage their profiles.
- **Financial Institution Portal**: Provides tools for managing loans, guarantor requests, and approvals.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Notifies users of request statuses and approvals.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures data protection and regulatory compliance.
